**More about Stencil:**
We designed Stencil to be the *fastest* way to design beautiful images and graphics for your website, blog, social media channels, podcast covers, eBook covers, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, or YouTube channels.

While other services (like Canva, PicMonkey, Vectr, Crello, BeFunky, Fotor, Snappa) and products (like Photoshop, Sketch, GIMP) are great for certain tasks, Stencil is the *fastest* way to get your images designed in a matter of minutes. If you're looking for a great Canva alternative or PicMonkey alternative, Stencil is the one!

We support **unlimited** uploads, meaning you can upload your entire collection of photos and graphics straight to Stencil for use. We support all the major image types (including JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP), and you can always download any images you uploaded back down to your computer later on.

**More about the Stencil for WordPress plugin:**
While Stencil on it's own is an amazing service, we (like you) spend a lot of time in our WordPress Admin area writing up our newest blogs and announcements.

Something we noticed while doing this is that it was a bit cumbersome switching tabs to Stencil to design our Featured Images for the blog post we were writing, download it, and then *re-uploading* into WordPress.

So we design this simple to use (and install) plugin so that you can use Stencil *right* from your WordPress Admin area.

This video will show you what that experience is like:
